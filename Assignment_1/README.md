The goal of this assignment is to learn to work with images by taking the digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate images
and automatically producing a color image with as few visual artifacts as possible. In order to do this, you will need
to extract the three color channel images, place them on top of each other, and align them so that they form a single
RGB color image.
