# Fourier-based Alignment and Finding Covariant Neighborhoods

- [Fourier-based Color Channel Alignment](https://github.com/hongbozheng/computer-vision/tree/main/assignment_2/fourier-based_color_channel_alignment)

  - For the first part of this assignment, we will revisit the color channel 
  alignment that you performed in Assignment 1. The goal in this assignment 
  is to perform color channel alignment using the Fourier transform. 
  As I said in lecture (and in notes, and on slides), convolution in the spatial 
  domain translates to multiplication in the frequency domain. Further, the Fast 
  Fourier Transform algorithm computes a transform in O(N M log N M) operations 
  for an N by M image. As a result, Fourier-based alignment may provide an 
  efficient alternative to sliding window alignment approaches for high-resolution images.

- [Scale-space Blob Construction](https://github.com/hongbozheng/computer-vision/tree/main/assignment_2/scale-space_blob_construction)

  - The goal of Part 2 of the assignment is to build a blob coordinate system as 
  discussed in lecture (and slides, and notes!).
