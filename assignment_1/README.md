# Registering Prokudin-Gorskii color separations of the Russian Empire

The goal of this assignment is to learn to work with images by taking the 
digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate images and automatically producing 
a color image with as few visual artifacts as possible. In order to do this, 
you will need to extract the three color channel images, place them on top of 
each other, and align them so that they form a single RGB color image.
